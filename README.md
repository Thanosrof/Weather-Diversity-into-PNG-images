This Python code is a script that I implemented for my thesis project. This script reads png images that are stored into a folder and adds weather conditions. 

There are five weather conditions that the program selects randomly from:
1) Sunny weather 
2) Cloudy weather
3) Rainy 
4) Snowy
5) Foggy 

## Usage
Using Python 3.8

python3 add_weather.py -i /Path/to/folder/

|Flag                  | Description
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------
| --i                  | Path to the folder containing the images 


##Examples
